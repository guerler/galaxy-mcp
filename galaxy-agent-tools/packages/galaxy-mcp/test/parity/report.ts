/**
 * The parity report: `PARITY.md` at the repository root, built from the surfaces
 * the check compares and the registry that records what it found.
 *
 * The registry is the enforcement half, and nobody opens a JSON file to find out
 * how the two surfaces are doing. This renders the same facts as something a diff
 * can show: the file is checked in, a test holds it to what the generator says,
 * and a pull request that moves parity moves the file in the same commit.
 *
 * It is built around a LIST of surfaces rather than two named ones, because a
 * third is coming -- Galaxy's own built-in MCP server -- and it should arrive as
 * another column and more divergences, not as a second report. What is still
 * pairwise is the divergence kinds: `missing-ts-param` names two sides, so a third
 * surface will have to say which pair each of its divergences is about.
