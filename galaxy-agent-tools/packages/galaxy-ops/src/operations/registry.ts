 * on the op's own run, another on an op it composes -- and they must not be able to reach
 * different conclusions. Reading the version once and passing it down makes that true by
 * construction, rather than by hoping two lookups land close enough together in time.
 *
 * Every claim is checked, not the first or the strictest: a copy of an op is held to its own
 * requirement AND to the registered op's, so it can tighten what it needs but never loosen it.
 * Nothing is looked up when no claim declares a requirement, so the version request only
 * happens where it could change the answer, and an unknown version passes -- the flag is here
 * to spare a caller a round trip that cannot succeed, not to gate a server we failed to read.
