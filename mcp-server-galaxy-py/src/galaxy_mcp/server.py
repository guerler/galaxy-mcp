Galaxy MCP exposes the Galaxy bioinformatics platform. Most tasks follow the
same shape: pick or create a history, upload data, run a Galaxy tool on the
data, then read results back from the history.

Two kinds of "tool" exist here and are easy to confuse:
- MCP tools (registered by this server) are operations like `upload_file`,
  `run_tool`, `get_histories`, `invoke_workflow`. They appear in tools/list.
- Galaxy tools (FastQC, Trimmomatic, Bowtie2, ...) are bioinformatics programs
  inside a Galaxy instance. They are NOT in the MCP tools/list. Find them with
  the MCP tools `search_tools_by_name` or `search_tools_by_keywords` (which
  query the connected Galaxy's tool catalog), then execute via
  `run_tool(history_id, tool_id, inputs)`.

For curated multi-step analyses, prefer `search_iwc_workflows` to find a
vetted Interactive Workflow Composer (IWC) workflow, then
`import_workflow_from_iwc` and `invoke_workflow`.

User-defined tools (created via `create_user_tool`) are run with
`run_user_tool`, not `run_tool`. Both post to the same Galaxy endpoint; the
difference is that a user-defined tool is addressed by UUID rather than tool id.

Pages are Galaxy-flavored markdown documents: a history-attached page is a
"Notebook", a standalone page a "Report". Manage them with `list_pages`,
`get_page`, `create_page`, and `update_page`; inspect edit history via
`list_page_revisions` / `get_page_revision` / `revert_page_revision`. Page
content embeds datasets through directives that use ENCODED ids (e.g.
`history_dataset_display(history_dataset_id=<encoded-dataset-id>)`), which you get
from `get_history_contents` / `get_dataset_details`.
"""

_CODE_MODE_INSTRUCTIONS = """\

This server is running in `--discovery-mode code`. The MCP tool catalog is
collapsed into three meta-tools:
- `search(query, ...)` -- find MCP tools by BM25 over names/descriptions
- `get_schema(tools=[...])` -- fetch parameter schemas for specific tools
- `run_galaxy_tool(code=...)` -- execute a Python script that calls MCP tools

Inside `run_galaxy_tool`, the only injected callable is
`call_tool(name: str, params: dict) -> Any`. Chain multiple calls in one
script and `return` the final answer to avoid round-trips.

`search` indexes the MCP tools (above), NOT Galaxy's full tool catalog. To
find a Galaxy tool like FastQC, call
`await call_tool('search_tools_by_name', {'name': 'fastqc'})` from inside
`run_galaxy_tool`.

    Upload a local file to Galaxy for analysis.

    Galaxy automatically detects the file type (FASTQ, BAM, BED, etc.) and

    """
    Search for workflows in the IWC (Intergalactic Workflow Commission) manifest.

    IWC hosts curated, best-practice workflows for common bioinformatics analyses.
    This function searches across workflow names, descriptions, tags, and readmes.
    Results are paginated: pagination.total_items is how many workflows matched,
    pagination.next_offset is where the next page starts.

    RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
    1. Search for workflows matching your analysis need
    2. Review the results - check step_count for complexity, readme_summary for details
    3. Call get_iwc_workflow_details(trs_id) for full information
    4. Import with import_workflow_from_iwc(trs_id)
    5. Run with invoke_workflow()

    Args:
        query: Search query (case-insensitive). Matches against:
               - Workflow name (e.g., "RNA-seq")
               - Description/annotation
               - Tags (e.g., "assembly", "transcriptomics")
        limit: Maximum workflows to return per page (default 20, max 100). A broad
               query matches most of the 123-workflow corpus, which is ~184 KB
               unpaged and more than an MCP client will pass through intact.
        offset: Skip this many matches (default 0). Pass pagination.next_offset
                to walk to the following page.

    Returns:
        GalaxyResult with this page of matching workflows in data field.
        Each workflow includes:
        - trsID: Unique identifier for importing
        - name: Human-readable workflow name
        - description: Brief annotation
        - tags: Category tags
        - readme_summary: First 300 chars of documentation
        - step_count: Number of workflow steps (complexity indicator)
        - authors: List of {name, orcid} for creators
        - categories: High-level category classifications

    automatically creates the tool for the importing user).

    avoids the most common user-defined-tool failure: inventing a tag, or using a
    bare image (e.g. "python:3.12-slim") that doesn't ship the libraries the tool
    imports.

    Args:
        packages: The conda packages the tool wraps, each as "name" or
            "name=version" (e.g. ["samtools=1.17", "bwa"]). Use canonical conda
            names you would `conda install` (e.g. "pandas", "r-ggplot2",

          the package names matched but no exact-version combination was established
          -- either the pinned version has no built tag, or no version was pinned --
          so the newest built tag was used).
        - source, notes: provenance and any explanatory notes.
        - verified: true if the exact tag is built on quay.io, false if positively
          absent, null if it could not be checked (non-biocontainer ref or a
          transient network error).

    NEXT STEPS:
    - If match_quality is "exact_version" and verified is not false, pass data["image"]
      as the "container" when calling create_user_tool.
    - If match_quality is "name_only", the version you asked for wasn't among the built
      tags (or you didn't pin one) and the newest tag was substituted -- show the user
      which image you got before using it.

    from the history if omitted). Omit history_id to create a standalone
    report -- reports REQUIRE both a title and a unique slug
    (lowercase/digits/hyphens).

    Content is Galaxy-flavored markdown. To embed a dataset, use a directive
    with the ENCODED dataset id, e.g.
    `history_dataset_display(history_dataset_id=<encoded-dataset-id>)` or
    `history_dataset_collection_display(history_dataset_collection_id=...)`.
    Get encoded ids from get_history_contents / get_dataset_details.

    Args:
        history_id: Encoded history id to attach the page to (notebook).
        title: Page title.
        content: Initial markdown content.

        slug: URL slug (required for standalone reports).

    Returns:
        GalaxyResult with the created page details including encoded id and
        content_editor in data.
